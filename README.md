Description:

A small online multiplayer FPS prototype built from a tutorial by DevLogLogan - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8D3vEx7NAE
I may add a few small features to this but I really just wanted to get a better understanding of multiplayer functionality in Godot 4.
Thanks for playing, and I hope you have fun!
